To set up this automatization process you have to use task scheduler on windows.

1. Set up a task for Executable_File.bat with your prefered settings, don't forget to add "Start in" parameter.

2. Set up Deletion.bat with the same settings, make sure it runs AFTER the program has finished running.

3. If you're using a laptop, change the advanced power saving settings so your computer can wake up automatically.

If you want to edit the time, edit the AAS.R file only. Send any questions to aukslius@gmail.com
